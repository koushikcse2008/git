You are asked to do below tasks against the git repository:
1) Download the repo (URL given)
3) Create a branch named demo_branch
4) Work on the code within demo_branch

Step 3:
$git branch demo_branch
$git checkout demo_branch
OR
$git checkout –b demo_branch

Step 4:
Work on the demo_branch codes

Step 5:
$git add .
Add all the files changed in your current branch to the staging area

Step 6:
